The basis of the game is built from this code: https://github.com/Gaspared/Pacman
The used custom font is "White Rabbit" by Matthew Welch.

We further implemented a second level and a menu. Some sound effects and a bonus item are now built in as well. Additionally, there are two different screens depending on if the player won or lost the game.
